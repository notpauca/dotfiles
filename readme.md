# dotfiles

just a setup i guess

## "Features": 
- Pretty Vanilla key bindings
- No animations or any distractions
- Works on my machineâ„¢

## Requirements: 
OS: Chimera Linux + GNOME\
Editor: Emacs\
Browser: Firefox (but any fork/derirative of it _should_ work)\
Shell: zsh\
Misc.: Spotify + Spicetify (not really configured here)

## Screenshot:

## Possible TODOs / plans / directions that this setup might go towards: 
- [ ] Add EFISTUB thingies, just a single script and that's it
- [ ] Make this work for my MBP (will require getting Chimera work with Asahi)
- [ ] A decent script to set all this up
- [ ] Thingies for MacOS
- [ ] Other DEs/compositors?
